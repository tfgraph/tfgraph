  This class acts as base class of transition behavior between vertices of the

  implementations.

  transitions.

  Attributes:
    sess (:obj:`tf.Session`): This attribute represents the session that runs
      the TensorFlow operations.
    name (str): This attribute represents the name of the object in TensorFlow's
      op Graph.
    writer (:obj:`tf.summary.FileWriter`): This attribute represents a
      TensorFlow's Writer, that is used to obtain stats.
    is_sparse (bool): Use sparse Tensors if it's set to True. Not
      implemented yet. Show the Todo.
    _listeners (:obj:`set`): The set of objects that will be notified when an
      edge modifies it weight.
    graph (:obj:`tfgraph.Graph`):  The graph on which the transition is referred.
