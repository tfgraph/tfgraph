class IterativePageRank(PageRank):
  """ The Iterative PageRank implementation.

  This class acts as the iterative algorithm to obtain the PageRank ranking of
  a graph.

  The PageRank algorithm calculates the rank of each vertex in a graph based on
  the relational structure from them and giving more importance to the vertices
  that connects with edges to vertices with very high in-degree recursively.

  This class depends on the TensorFlow library, so it's necessary to install it
  to properly work.

  Attributes:
    sess (:obj:`tf.Session`): This attribute represents the session that runs
      the TensorFlow operations.
    name (str): This attribute represents the name of the object in TensorFlow's
      op Graph.
    beta (float): The reset probability of the random walks, i.e. the
      probability that a user that surfs the graph an decides to jump to another
      vertex not connected to the current.
    transition (:obj:`tfgraph.Transition`): The transition matrix that provides the
      probability distribution relative to the walk to another node of the graph.
    v (:obj:`tf.Variable`): The stationary distribution vector. It contains the
      normalized probability to stay in each vertex of the graph. So represents
      the PageRank ranking of the graph.
    writer (:obj:`tf.summary.FileWriter`): This attribute represents a
      TensorFlow's Writer, that is used to obtain stats.
    is_sparse (bool): Use sparse Tensors if it's set to True. Not implemented
      yet.
    iter (:obj:`tf.Tensor`): The operation that will be repeated in each
      iteration of the algorithm.
